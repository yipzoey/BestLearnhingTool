 <h2>Making Breads</h2>   
    <p>Breads are produced by milling grains to a fine flour and mixing them with water. 
      Not all breads contain added yeast - these are known as unleavened breads - but fermented dough products all contain yeast of one variety or another.
      The classic process of breadmaking goes as follows: Form dough  ➞  Knead  ➞  Proof  ➞  (Knock back)  ➞  2nd Proof  ➞  Shape ➞  Bake

<h2>Fermentation</h2>   

<p><storng>Fermentation </storng>occurs when yeast is introduced to a product. 
  The yeast feeds on sugars within the product, breaking them down and giving off carbon dioxide as a by product; 
  in dough products it is this carbon dioxide that provides the <strong>lift</strong>during proving. 
  As well as carbon dioxide, the yeast converts the fermentable sugars into ethanol and other byproducts, known as congeners. 
  It is the presence of these congeners that imbue the bread with its distinctive ‘fresh bread’ flavour. </p>
