 <h2>Types of Biscuits</h2>   
    <p>Biscuits, cakes and sponges fall under the remit of ‘pastry’. They have many applications but are most commonly 
      used as the basis for sweet dessert or petits-fours courses, or as accompaniments to an afternoon tea.
      The biscuit takes its name from the French words <em>bis</em> (meaning twice), and </em>cuit</em>(meaning ‘cooked’ or ‘baked’). 
      Traditionally, biscuits would have always been baked twice to give a hard, dry texture that could be stored for long periods of time without spoiling - such as a ship’s biscuit, which was baked dry in order to be taken on long sea voyages without spoiling. 
      The Italian biscotti is still baked in the traditional way. Most modern day biscuits, however, are only baked once.

<h2>Short Bread</h2>   

<p>Shortbread falls somewhere in between a <strong>rolled biscuit</strong> and a <strong>dropped biscuit</strong>. 
  It is made using the creaming method, just like a rolled biscuit, but though it can be rolled the dough is often shaped by hand or pressed into a tin.
  Shortbread makes a great accompaniment to soft desserts, such as <em>crème brûlée or chocolate mousse</em>, adding a firm texture to the dish. 
  It can be flavoured using all manner of ingredients, from chocolate chips or sultanas to lavender or orange.
