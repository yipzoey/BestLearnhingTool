 <h2>Types of Desserts</h2>   
    <p>
    What is a dessert? A dessert is a dish that is traditionally eaten at the end of a meal. 
    It can be a savoury dish, but it is more often a sweetened dish typically containing fruits, dairy, chocolate or sugar. 
    <strong>Hot desserts</strong> are served warm, either immediately after having been cooked, or having been warmed prior to service. 
    <strong>Cold desserts</strong> are served at room temperature or below. 
    They are typically set desserts, fixed through cooking, freezing, chilling, or the use of setting agents such as gelatine, agar agar or pectin.

<h2>Gelatines</h2>   

<p>Gelatine is used to set a dessert that is to be served at room temperature or chilled. It is most famously the setting agent used in jelly. 
Gelatine is graded by its <strong>Bloom strength</strong>. This is normally graded as bronze, silver or gold - bronze being the lowest Bloom value and gold being the highest. The Bloom value refers to the firmness or strength of the set gel, so a gold gelatine will give a firmer set than an equal quantity of bronze or silver gelatine.
